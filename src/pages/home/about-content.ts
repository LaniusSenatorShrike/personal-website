      "Hey there! 👋 I'm the guy who gets unreasonably excited about data pipelines. Currently leading the chaos at Marktplaats (yes, the Dutch eBay) where I convince computers to move billions of events without catching fire.",
      "My superpower? Making Kafka behave and turning 'it works on my machine' into 'it processes 10 million notifications per hour.' AWS and GCP certified, which basically means I've clicked through a lot of cloud consoles and lived to tell the tale.",
      "When I'm not wrestling with distributed systems or mentoring engineers, you'll find me exploring Amsterdam by bike, breaking things in production (just kidding... mostly), and dreaming about perfectly partitioned data. Let's build something cool together! 🚀"
